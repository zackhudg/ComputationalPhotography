# ComputationalPhotography

This code shows completed assignments for my Computational Photography class in the Spring of 2022, which used MATLAB.

Assignments consist of starter code, provided by the professor, which was then edited, added to, or fixed by me for the assignment.

Topics covered in this course include convolutions and filters, compression and sampling, the laplacian pyramid, matrix transformations (both perspective and affine), and more.
